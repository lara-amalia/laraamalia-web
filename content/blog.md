Sometimes I like it to write. As a personal challenge I am going to publish articles about web development on this blog. The focus will be on HTML, CSS and maybe some JavaScript basics later on. In between it could be that I also tell you some less techie, but more personal things. Let’s see where the journey will take me… :-)

There will be no German version of the blog. Sorry!
